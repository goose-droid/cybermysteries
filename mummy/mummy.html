			<p>The first of Frogwares' eight-game Sherlock Holmes adventure game series, <em>The Mystery of the Mummy</em>, debuted in November of 2002.</p>
			<p>It's a first-person point-and-click adventure game where you play as Holmes, and solve a mystery surrounding a missing person. Lord Montcalfe, a rich Egypt nerd & archeologist, is supposedly dead, but his daughter believes he is still alive, and suspecting foul play, hired Holmes. The case takes place in the man's mansion, which is filled to the brim with ancient Egyptian artefacts, and each level of the game covers certain rooms or floors. In addition to the regular artefacts, there is also a living mummy wandering around, which poses no serious threat to Holmes, but stars in a few rather cheesy cutscenes.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, Watson doesn't show up in the game until quite late, and for the majority of the game, Holmes is quite alone in this large, old mansion. The lack of NPCs is a large difference to Frogwares'  later Holmes titles, but it does add to the atmosphere in this game. In fact, the atmosphere is one of the best things in an other-wise rather dull game. It's a free download on Steam, and for good reason: the fact that it's Frogwares' first game is painfully obvious. Never-the-less, it has its charms, and is worth taking a look at for any fan of the series (just be sure to have a walkthrough at hand!)</p>
